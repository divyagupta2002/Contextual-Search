# Hybrid Search

This project implements a hybrid search algorithm that combines both vector and textual search techniques. The goal of this algorithm is to provide more accurate and relevant search results by leveraging the strengths of both approaches.

## Features

- **Vector Search**: The algorithm utilizes vector representations of documents to capture semantic similarities between them. This allows for more precise matching and ranking of search results based on their semantic relevance.

- **Textual Search**: In addition to vector search, the algorithm also incorporates traditional textual search techniques. This includes keyword matching, phrase matching, and other text-based search strategies to ensure comprehensive coverage of search queries.

- **Ranking**: The hybrid search algorithm employs a ranking mechanism that combines the results from both vector and textual search. This ensures that the most relevant documents are presented at the top of the search results, taking into account both semantic similarity and textual relevance.
